# üß∞College Toolboxüß∞

Welcome to College Toolbox, your all-in-one web application for managing your college life more efficiently. This web app is built using Astro and is designed to help students streamline various aspects of their college experience, from tracking job and scholarship applications to generating tuition schedules and discovering useful college websites.

### üõ†Installation

#### Pre-requisites

1. Docker [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
Installing Docker is a decently involved process. Be sure to follow every step carefully.
The two commonly hardest steps are:

- Installing WSL: if you're running Windows, you will need to install WSL. Pick Ubuntu as the Linux distro to install.
- Enabling Virtualization: To do this you will need to enter your BIOS and find the virtualization settings. You can enter the BIOS by restarting your computer and mashing the F2, F8, F12, or Del key (it depends LOL). Once in the BIOS, you can lookup a tutorial for enabling it for your particular BIOS (mine was the [MSI Click 5](https://liquidsky.com/how-to-enable-virtualization-msi-click-bios-5/))

2. Git Bash or another flavor of Bash
3. Python
4. Poetry: `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`
5. Add the following line to your [PATH](https://gist.github.com/nex3/c395b2f8fd4b02068be37c961301caa7):
 `%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts`
6. Node [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
